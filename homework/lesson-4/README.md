# Exercises on Data Structures (Lists, Sets, Tuples)             

## Exercise 0
**Given the following scores, what is the length of the list?**

```python
scores = [5, 6, 6, 13, 6, 16, 2, 4, 6, 15, 3, 7, 20, 3, 24, 24, 1, 23, 3, 3, 3, 21, 7, 2, 12]
```

## Exercise 1:
**Given the same list of scores, write a program that counts the number of 3s in the list**


## Exercise 2:
**Given the same list of scores, find the maximum in the list**


## Exercise 3:
**Given the following two lists, write a program that prints the common elements**

```python
list_1 = ["foo", 2, "bar", 3, "baz", "spam", 4]
list_2 = ["1", 2, "3", 3, "4", "foo", "pasm", "bar"]
```

## Exercise 4:
**Given the following list of numbers, write a program**
1. that goes through each number in the list
2. appends it to a new list called `positive_numbers` if the number is positive

```python
all_numbers = [111, 32, -9, -45, -17, 9, 85, -10]
```

## Exercise 5:
**Print the items of the given list in reverse**

```python
reverse_this_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

## Exercise 6
**Convert the scores list (from Exercise 0) into a set and print its elements**

## Exercise 7
**Create a List of Tuples with 5 country names and their capitals, and print the list**

Each tuple should contain one country and its capital
