# Exercise 1 

A- What is the name of a built-in function in "random" package which can generates random integers?  
B- Programming:
   Using the function in section A, generate 10 integers that are between 1 and 100.
   Create a list. Call it rand_numbers. Use this list to save the generated integers. Print the list.
   Calculate the average of the numbers in rand_numbers and display the result. (Feel free to write a function for this calculation.)
C- Is there any built-in function in Python that can calculate average of numbers?
   If "yes" use that function to calculate the average of rand_numbers and display the result.
D- Is the result of section B and C the same?

# Exercise 2 

Create a Calculator that can perform four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division!
Your program asks the user to input the operation they want to perform and input two numbers.
Then it performs the operation and display the result.

Instructions:
Write a function for each arithmetic operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
If the user entered an invalid operation, print an appropriate message to inform them.
Your program handles errors (like dividing by zero) and invalid input (like entering a letter instead of a number).

# Exercise 3 

Create "Guess the Number" game!
Your program generates a random number between 1 and 100. Then asks the user to guess the random number.
The user have 5 times to guess the number. If they cannot guess it correctly during this 5 rounds, they loose.
Each round that the user guess the number wrong, your program gives the user a hint like "Too low!" or "Too high!".
If the guess is correct it should print "Correct!" and prints the number of tries.

Instructions:
Write a function to generate a random number.
Write a function to ask the user for their guess.
Write a function to check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
Write a main function that loops until the user guesses correctly and provides feedback.
